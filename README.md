# FDTrainingCenter
This ymap is a training center for the FD. There are three courses located in LS port. The first is a boat. The second is a small room lit on fire while the task is to escape while getting rid of the fire. Finally, there is a large building that is set on fire, the goal is to remove the fire from all floors (fire escapes act as floors).
